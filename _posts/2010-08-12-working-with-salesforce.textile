For the past six months, I've been working at <a href="http://hoopla.net">Hoopla Software</a> writing applications to be sold on Salesforce's <a href="http://sites.force.com/appexchange/results?type=Apps&keywords=Hoopla">AppExchange</a>. The first five months were spent writing a Rails app that interfaced with Salesforce using their API, the last month has been spent writing native Apex code (which is a delight that can only be described in relation to the circles of hell). Consider this a "lesson's learned" type post.
