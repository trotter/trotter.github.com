<p class="meta">October 11, 2010 - Philly</p>

When I first moved to Philly from New York, I started telling people that
Philly was two years behind The City in tech. Philly's Ruby group was the size
of New York's from two years before. There were no real Ruby luminaries here,
and really few tech luminaries at all in the area. Still, it felt like it had
potential, hence my thinking it was just two years behind. Sadly, I'm now
starting to see it fall three, even four years behind, and it's a trend that
we're going to stop.

The Promised Land
-----------------

The Problem
-----------

- Pool of talented tech is small
  - All meetings are full of the same people
  - Plenty of developers, many are 9-5ers
- Lack of startups
- Few VC firms
  - Ones we have, like Ben Franklin are stuck in old ways
- Lack of progressive tech organizations
  - Comcast, Siemens, others??
  - Java, Java, Java

Our Strengths

How We're Getting There
