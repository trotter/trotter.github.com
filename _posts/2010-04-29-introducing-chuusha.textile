CSS doesn't have variables. This probably doesn't come as news to you, and I'm sure you've felt the pain. What's even worse, now that I'm doing a lot of drawing using Raphael, I have color and size constants that I'm sharing between CSS and JavaScript. It's really brittle, and brittle is bad.

So how can we fix this problem? "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ is one option, and it's pretty damn sweet. Sadly, it too can't share variables with JavaScript, and it's ever so slightly divergent from CSS. I don't like forcing my team members (especially the designery types) to learn too many new things. Like any good developer, I wrote my own library! (Be sure to read that last sentence with all the sarcasm it deserves)
