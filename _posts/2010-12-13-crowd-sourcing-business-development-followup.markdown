A few months ago, I wrote a post about [crowd sourcing business
development](/2010/10/26/crowd-sourcing-business-development.html) at
Mashion. Sadly, that post did not seem to actually get us any business.
So, effective immediately, the official deal is off.  This does not mean
that we won't still offer discounts to select customers or commissions
to cool people, it just means that we don't have a structured format for
doing so. And as always, feel free to contact us if you have any work
you would like done. We're really good at Rails, JavaScript, and Chef.
