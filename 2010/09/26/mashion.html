  <h1 id='starting_a_company'>Starting a Company</h1>

<p>So that&#8217;s that, <a href='http://matschaffer.com'>Mat</a> and I have officially started a company. It&#8217;s a Rails / Javascript / anything else consulting company named <a href='http://mashion.net'>Mashion</a>. We officially start tomorrow, but we&#8217;ve been working the past two weeks to build up a little bit of business.</p>

<h2 id='companies_are_work'>Companies Are Work</h2>

<p>As I&#8217;m starting to find out, running a business is hard work. Over the past two weeks, Mat and I incorporated a company, started discussions with potential clients, got a company credit card, and started to plan our strategy at night while finishing our final two weeks at our old jobs as developers at <a href='http://hoopla.net'>Hoopla</a>. It feels like we&#8217;ve had a meeting every night for the past two weeks with yet another person looking for some Rails or Javascript help. I&#8217;m really looking forward to next week, when not <em>all</em> of our client discussions have to be done on off hours.</p>

<p>As you may imagine, starting a company and finding clients really comes down to task management. To stay on top of things, it&#8217;s absolutely essential that you have a good customer relationship management tool into which you put <em>every last bit</em> of customer data. We&#8217;re using <a href='http://highrisehq.com'>Highrise</a>, and it totally rocks. After spending 7 months developing applications for Salesforce, Highrise is a breath of fresh air. So far, its strongest two features are that it&#8217;ll properly file anything you email to it and it puts pictures next to client names. <img alt='Contact Picture' src='/images/2010-09-26-mashion/pictures-with-contacts.jpg' /> I love having a picture next to a name (which you can see over to the right), because it really helps me think of these names on a webpage as people that I know.</p>

<h2 id='im_terrified'>I&#8217;m Terrified</h2>

<p>Starting a company is completely terrifying. We&#8217;ve lined up a few weeks of work now, but I&#8217;m still afraid that the pipeline will dry up on a moment&#8217;s notice. We&#8217;re currently a small fish in a giant pond, where a <a href='http://pivotallabs.com/'>number</a> of <a href='http://hashrocket.com'>successful</a> <a href='http://thoughtbot.com'>companies</a> are already established. Outside the stress of competition, the economy could always decide to tank again. I try not to think about that, but it&#8217;s a pretty real possibility. So yea, this could completely blow up in my face, and that has me scared pretty shitless.</p>

<h2 id='were_qualified'>We&#8217;re Qualified</h2>

<p>However, I&#8217;m not going to let the fear drive me away. I think we can beat (or better yet: work with) the big guys in certain cases. We&#8217;re a tiny company, but we&#8217;re extremely talented. When a client needs a chisel instead of a sledge hammer, we&#8217;ll be there.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve spent the past our lives learning everything we can and subconsciously preparing for this moment. The <a href='/'>talks I&#8217;ve given, the books I&#8217;ve written</a>, and work I&#8217;ve done have all lead to this. We are definitely Rails and Javascript experts, and we&#8217;ll help any team learn to perform at its full potential.</p>

<h2 id='our_future'>Our Future</h2>

<p>With our future starting now, our primary focus is on finding more clients. We want companies and teams that need help improving their development process or kickstarting a new product and think that we can give them the boost they need. If you&#8217;re interested, <a href='mailto:trotter@mashion.net'>email me</a>.</p>

<p>After lining up some clients, we also want to spend a little time on products. <a href='http://simulchart.com'>Simulchart</a> has been sitting neglected for the past month and is in need of some development love. Our hope is to turn it into a for pay product by the end of the year. After that, we&#8217;ve got a million other small product ideas in mind, and I can&#8217;t wait to show them to you.</p>

<h2 id='the_beginning'>The Beginning</h2>

<p>Overall, this feels like the best career decision I&#8217;ve ever made. It&#8217;s simultaneously terrifying and exciting, but I can&#8217;t think of a better reason to live with permanent butterflies in my stomach. No matter what happens, Mat and I are going to make the best of this experience and come out better for it. Besides, if all else fails, at least I&#8217;m going to get to work on some cool stuff. Isn&#8217;t that what all programmers dream of anyway?</p>
