<p class='meta'>October 26, 2010 - Philly</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: The deal below is no longer active. I&#8217;m leaving this blog post on the web though as a matter of historical record.</p>

<p><a href='http://mashion.net'>Mashion</a>, my web development consultancy, will pay you 5% for introducing us to someone that becomes a client. We will pay you 10% if you negotiate the contract for us. Occasionally, we&#8217;ll pay you 15% when we&#8217;re looking for work immediately. We charge $150 per hour and average around 30 hours of work per week per developer. Ergo, if you deliver us a four week contract for two developers, you&#8217;ll make <strong>$3,600</strong>. For serious.</p>

<p>Email us at <a href='mailto:info@mashion.net'>info@mashion.net</a> with deals and read on for details.</p>

<h2 id='why_it_makes_sense'>Why It Makes Sense</h2>

<p>Business development takes time, especially when first getting started. In the first four weeks of Mashion, we&#8217;ve had 3 contracts. Two have lasted a week, and one was only two days. We&#8217;ve also had a week and a half of downtime in which we worked on our own projects, while hustling hard to get some more business. As it stands, it feels like we&#8217;ve spent at least <strong>25%</strong> of our time on business development. That&#8217;s a really big cost, and I think we can crowd source it away.</p>

<h2 id='how_it_works'>How It Works</h2>

<p>Currently, we&#8217;re paying 5% of the total contract if you bring a potential customer to us, and they sign a contract within two months. We&#8217;re paying 10% of the total contract if you act as a middle man between us and the customer. You&#8217;re responsible for negotiating the rate with them and getting them to sign a contract that we agree upon. You&#8217;ll get paid when we get paid, and you don&#8217;t get paid if we don&#8217;t get paid. These terms are subject to change, and we&#8217;ll announce all changes either on this blog or on our <a href='http://mashion.net'>website</a>.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, we&#8217;ll offer a 15% bounty to the first person to bring us a signed contract that starts immediately. Follow us on twitter to find out about those times: <a href='http://twitter.com/cashion'>@cashion</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/matschaffer'>@matschaffer</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a potential client yourself, you can get a 10% discount by showing up with a contract ready to sign. If we&#8217;re offering a bounty, you can get a 15% discount by being the first to sign a contract that starts immediately.</p>

<p>We charge $150 per hour and stay away from fixed-price contracts.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got some work that you want to send our way, email us at <a href='mailto:info@mashion.net'>info@mashion.net</a>. If this post hits number one on <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com'>Hacker News</a>, we may take a day or two to respond. Don&#8217;t worry, we love you for sending us work, and we will <em>definitely</em> write back.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re a lawyer, please contact us about writing actual contracts around this business.</p>

<h2 id='about_us'>About Us</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;ve read this far, hopefully you&#8217;re thinking of bringing us some business. To do that, you&#8217;ll need to know a little about what we do.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re a web development consultancy that specializes in Rails. We&#8217;re pretty handy with Javascript and Devops as well. We&#8217;re Agile, pair program, practice TDD, love <a href='http://cukes.info'>Cucumber</a>, and enjoy teaching. We like to work closely with our clients to deliver a product that everyone is happy with.</p>

<p>We bill hourly, because we think that fixed price contracts always leave one side feeling screwed. We have two developers and average 30 hours per week per developer.</p>

<p>We aren&#8217;t designers, but we have <a href='http://thoughtmerchants.com/'>one we like</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re really good, and we&#8217;re proud of it.</p>
